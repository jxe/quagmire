/// single-row drags include just the one. The drop destination looks each ID up in
/// `document.blocks` to find the source indices and computes the move.

/// Forwards through `ProxyRepresentation` to `String` rather than declaring a custom
/// UTI conforming to `public.data`. CodableRepresentation over data-conforming UTIs
